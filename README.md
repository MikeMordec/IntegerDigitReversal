# Integer Digit Reversal

## Overview

This repository contains a C++ program that implements a function to reverse the digits of an integer. The program includes support for negative numbers and leading zeroes.

## Features

- Reverses the digits of any integer input.
- Handles negative numbers correctly.
- Preserves leading zeroes in the reversed output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Command-line interface (CLI) or an IDE to compile and run the program

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IntegerDigitReversal.git

    Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.

Usage

    Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, with g++:

    bash

g++ PE_6-9.cpp -o reverse_digit

Run the compiled executable:

bash

    ./reverse_digit

    Follow the on-screen instructions to enter an integer and see its digits reversed.

Example

Suppose you want to reverse the digits of the integer 12345. Running the program would produce the following output:

sql

Enter an integer: 12345
12345 with digits reversed = 54321, leading zeroes if any are not shown.
